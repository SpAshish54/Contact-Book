    The input is taken from user, input consists of Name, Father's Name, Mother's Name, UID No, Phone Number
    
    Using Phone Number as Base we build a Trie Using a Phone Number, and only Phone Number is stored in Trie 
    
    Data Structure, after building the Trie Using Phone Number, we save details of a person in external File
    
    Using File Management/Accessing Methods of CPP, and the External File is saved as <"PhoneNumber.txt">,
    
    Now we can Access the basic detials of person from that File, like wise updation can also be done.
